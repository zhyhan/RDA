# Robust Domain Adaptation 

Code release for "Towards Accurate and Robust Domain Adaptation under Multiple Noisy Environments" submitted into TKDE.
## Prerequisites:

* Python == 3.7
* PyTorch ==1.8.1 (with suitable CUDA and CuDNN version)
* torchvision == 0.9.01
* Numpy
* argparse
* easydict
* pillow = 2.3.5
* tqdm

## Dataset:

You need to modify the path of the image in every ".txt" in "./data".
The COVID-19 dataset can be downloaded at the [BaiduCloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/17KEGkPmue6jBRRq6pGVF4Q) and the code is c8kk.

## Training:

You can run "./scripts/train.sh" to train and evaluate on the task. Before that, you need to change the project root, dataset (Office-home or Office-31), data address and CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES in the script.
